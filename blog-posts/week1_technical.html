            <h3><a href="http://rtve.es">rtve.es:</a> My top-pick website is hands-down rtve.es. It's Spain’s national broadcast site, with a truly impressive multi-media spread. They feature:
                   <ul><li>4 channels of live tv, 24 hours a day</li>
                          <li>Literally hundreds of (if not more) on demand documentaries and series</li>
                          <li>Regional, national, and international news</li>
                          <li>Audio, podcasts, etc.</li></ul>
            <p>And I mean I could just go on describing just how much really great programming they offer, and all this content is freely available to the international public! The homepage is incredibly visually stimulating, as they color code all their content into different categories with eye-grabbing headlines. It has a very modern yet functional appeal which I personally am drawn to day after day. So if you’re in the mood to brush up on your <em>castellano</em>, ¡esta es la página para ti!</p></h3>

           <h3><a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive:</a><p> As a child of the 90’s - early 2000’s,  I can remember the stress of being assigned a Word document or an infamous PowerPoint, because I did not have an authentic Microsoft Office package. It was annoying having to keep renewing trials, downloading bootleg versions, or even trying to switch over to not-so great options such as Open Office. (Which I once did an entire project on, just to find it was incompatible with my teacher’s computer on the day of a presentation. Not fun!) Anyhow, as you might get the feel, I had great contempt for Office… But ever since a great childhood friend came back one summer from UF and introduced me to Google Drive, I’ve never left its side . I mean where sdo I begin, the perks are innumerable:</p>
                      <ul><li>Clean cut design with an incredibly easy user interface</li>
                             <li>15 GB of storage</li>
                             <li>Ability to make folders, documents, spreadsheets, forms, presentations, drawings, etc.</li>
                             <li>Automatic change saves! (How many people have lost entire projects because of forgetting to enter CTRL+S)</li>
                             <li>Real time collaboration, automatic updates, universal access to projects through Internet</li>
                             <li>FREE!</li></ul> 

          <p>Google Drive has just really won a special place on my computer; how fortunate to finally have access to a package like this!</p></h3>

<h3><a href="http://livemocha.com">Livemocha.com</a><p>Being bilingual undoubtedly plays an all- important role in my life. Livemocha.com is an interactive language learning site where users are able to choose to learn from 38 different languages through lessons and practice with native speakers. The color palette, design, and features really make for an aesthetically pleasing experience. It kinda gives me a modern yet old-world traveler feel, and I like that. Recently on a trip down to Ft. Lauderdale, I was able to use my portuguese skills with a group of friends from Brazil, who were so surprised to find out all I knew was self-taught through a website.</p></h3>
 
 <h3><p>In all, I’m an aficionado of these websites and their services and highly recommend them for content, navigability, usefulness, and entertainment. Because I am biased I generally don’t find any cons to their user experiences, but I will keep an eye out.</p></h3>
