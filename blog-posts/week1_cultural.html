           <h3><p>Based on Shereef’s Fireside Chat, a great sense of gratitude and joy sprung in me for being a part of DBC. My impression is that this is a program where its participants are really led by example. I see myself as a fish in water with the emotional intelligence values DBC is promoting among its cohorts, and feel I will be able to learn so much from the culture of mindfulness at DBC.</p></h3>

           <h3><p>After watching the Fireside Chat I actually felt comforted to hear from Shereef about the amount of effort that is expected. The reason why it comforted me was because it gave me affirmation that it’s alright to feel a bit nervous, that the bottom line is to actually learn engineering principles and build an engineering sense. That I just need to press on and give it my all in order to reap my maximum potential.</p></h3>
