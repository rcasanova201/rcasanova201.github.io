           <h1> Wireframing Blog:</h1>
           <h3>Ok, so first up would be <a href="http://rtve.es"> rtve.es </a> , and I'm choosing to wireframe my favorite show, <a href="http://www.rtve.es/television/comando-actualidad"> Comando Actualidad</a>.</h3>

           <h3> This page's wireframe helps by ordering and categorizing video links into a digital library that features the latest episodes. It provides captions to inform the user of each video's content, along with links to older episodes and social media following the show. Since the background of the webpage is currently black with orange specks, there's a lot of contrast between the white layout. It also can give a feel of information overload.</h3>

           <h3>Followed by <a href= "http://drive.google.com"> Google Drive:</a>

           <h3>Google Drive's wireframing provides for a hassle-free creation and search of documents. I can easily navigate through my files because folders are listed in sequential order. But it's also possible to rearrange and catalog them as it suits best. Due to the minimalistic design (which I find so great), I personally don't have any visual challenges with it. Actually, I like the predictability and stability this wireframe creates (once you know where eveything is it doesn't change).</h3>

           <h3>Livemocha.com's homepage neatly divides information that a user would like to know, such as "What is this page all about?" I'm pretty satified with the wireframing distribution of the content. It's appealing enough that you will read throughout the whole page in order to get a gist of it.</h3>
